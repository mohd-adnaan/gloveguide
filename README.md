# ðŸ§¤ Glove Guide

**Glove Guide** is a wearable navigation system for cyclists, runners, and pedestrians that uses vibration feedback to provide turn-by-turn directions â€” no screens or sounds required. By integrating small motors into gloves and connecting them via Bluetooth to a mobile app using Google Maps API, users can focus on the road while navigating safely.

## Overview

- Reduces distraction from checking phones.
- Provides intuitive left/right vibration cues.
- Maintains full environmental awareness (no earphones or screens).
- Ideal for cyclists, runners, and visually impaired users.

## System design

**Hardware:** Gloves, ESP32, vibration actuators, battery, driver circuit.

**Software:**

- Mobile app â†’ gets directions from Google Maps API.
- Bluetooth â†’ sends turn instructions to ESP32.
- ESP32 firmware â†’ activates the correct glove motor.

## Workflow

1. Set route in the Glove Guide mobile app.
2. Directions sent via Bluetooth to ESP32.
3. Left/right glove vibrates for turns.
4. User navigates safely, hands- and eyes-free.

## Ethics summary

- **Participants:** 5â€“10 cyclists (ages 17â€“70).
- **Risks:** Same as regular cycling.
- **Mitigation:** Only experienced riders participate.
