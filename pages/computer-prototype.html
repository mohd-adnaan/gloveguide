            <p>This report presents the design evolution, prototype implementation, and usability evaluation plan for
                Glove Guide, a haptic navigation system developed to enhance safety and convenience for cyclists and
                pedestrians. The project aims to replace traditional visual and auditory navigation cues with intuitive
                haptic feedback delivered through wearable components such as gloves or bracelets, allowing users to
                remain attentive to their surroundings while navigating.</p>

            <p>Building on insights from earlier low-fidelity testing, this deliverable details the refined prototype,
                the procedures for usability testing, and the methods for data recording and reporting. It also includes
                a comprehensive user manual to ensure that evaluators can operate the system independently. Together,
                these materials provide a clear framework for assessing the system's usability and guiding further
                refinements toward a fully functional, user-validated prototype.</p>

        <!-- Design Evolution Section -->
        <div class="content-section" id="design-evolution">
            <h2 class="section-title">Design Evolution</h2>
            <p>Following the low-fidelity prototype testing and peer feedback, several revisions were identified to
                enhance both the usability and technical feasibility of the Glove Guide system. These design evolutions
                were driven by direct user observations, peer comments, and new insights gained during preliminary
                implementation planning.</p>

            <p><b>1. Transition from Planned Google Maps API to Apple Maps API/Kit</b>
                While the team initially planned to implement navigation functionality using the Google Maps API,
                subsequent study with members of the target user group—including participants from the low-fidelity
                usability test—showed that most users primarily relied on Apple Maps for daily navigation. In addition,
                the development team possesses stronger experience with the iOS platform. As a result, the team decided
                to adopt Apple Maps API/Kit for future development to better align with user familiarity and streamline
                implementation.
                Justification: Improved intuitiveness for users and higher development feasibility due to platform
                expertise.</p>

            <p><b>2. Improved Bracelet Feedback through Adjustable Straps</b>
                Test participants reported inconsistent haptic sensations from the bracelet, often caused by variable
                tightness around the wrist. To address this issue, the new prototype includes adjustable straps,
                enabling users to control the fit according to personal comfort. This modification ensures more
                consistent haptic transmission and enhances the reliability of feedback during use.
                Justification: Increased reliability, effectiveness, and overall user satisfaction.</p>

            <p><b>3. Lightweight Fingerless Glove Design</b>
                During the initial tests, users found that the glove design restricted their hand movements and felt
                cumbersome. To improve comfort and usability, the new iteration adopts a lightweight, fingerless glove,
                allowing free finger movement while retaining necessary sensing and feedback functionality.
                Justification: Improved user comfort and satisfaction during use.</p>

            <p><b>4. Customizable Haptic Feedback Settings</b>
                Usability testing revealed notable individual differences in how participants perceived and preferred
                haptic feedback. For example, Participant 1 reported that the vibration intensity was generally
                comfortable and clear, whereas Participant 2 found the vibrations too subtle when moving the arm.
                Confidence ratings in interpreting directional cues ranged between 3.5 and 5.0, indicating variability
                across users.
                To accommodate these differences, the new prototype includes a customization interface allowing users
                to:</p>

            <p>
                <li>Adjust vibration intensity to their preference.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Choose how many seconds before a turn the vibration should begin.</li>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>This feature personalizes the interaction, improving clarity and overall user confidence.
                    Justification: Enhanced reliability, effectiveness, and user satisfaction through personalization
                    and adaptability.</li>
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Prototype Implementation Section -->
        <div class="content-section" id="prototype-implementation">
            <h2 class="section-title">Prototype Implementation</h2>
            <p>The computer-based prototype of the Glove Guide builds upon the structure of the earlier low-fidelity
                version and continues to consist of three main components: electrical, physical, and <b>software
                    application</b> elements. Together, these components enable users to experience the full "look and
                feel" of the intended system with minimal reliance on Wizard of Oz techniques.</p>

            <p><b>Electrical Components</b>

            <p>The electrical system remains the same from the previous iteration, as it already fulfilled the intended
                functionality.The electrical system remains unchanged from the previous iteration, as it already
                fulfilled the intended functionality. It includes two switches, each connected to a distinct vibration
                motor positioned on the left and right sides of the wearable parts. When a switch is activated, the
                corresponding motor provides haptic feedback to the user, and the vibration stops when the switch is
                turned off. This setup ensures precise and immediate tactile cues corresponding to directional signals.
            </p>

            <p><b>Physical Components</b>

            <p>The physical design has been updated to reflect user feedback obtained during the low-fidelity testing
                phase. The full-hand gloves have been replaced by lightweight, fingerless gloves, and the fixed-tight
                bracelets have been replaced with an adjustable strap design. These adjustments improve comfort and
                usability by allowing users to move freely and customize the fit according to personal preference. The
                vibration components remain securely attached to the physical parts in the same relative positions as
                before—specifically, the left vibration motor is mounted on the left wearable, and the right motor on
                the right wearable—ensuring clear directional correspondence between haptic feedback and navigational
                cues.</p>

            <p><b>Software Application</b>
            <p>The most significant progress has been achieved in the software component. The user interfaces developed
                during the paper prototype stage have been implemented as an iOS application. The app provides users
                with all key interactions that were identified as central during the low-fidelity testing phase,
                including:</p>

            <p>The application can be easily installed on standard iOS devices without requiring special technical
                skills, ensuring accessibility and portability for future usability testing. This implementation now
                allows users to interact directly with the system's main functions, providing a realistic impression of
                its final look and feel.</p>

            <p><b>Alignment with Project Objectives</b>
            <p>The Glove Guide project aims to enhance navigational safety by replacing visual and auditory navigation
                outputs with haptic feedback, allowing users to remain attentive to their surroundings while receiving
                navigation instructions. The current prototype successfully demonstrates this functionality by
                delivering directional guidance through tactile cues, meeting the project's central objective of
                hands-free, eyes-free navigation.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- User Population Section -->
        <div class="content-section" id="user-population">
            <h2 class="section-title">User Population</h2>
            <p>In the initial project proposal, five user segments were defined; however, subsequent review revealed
                that these segments did not adequately reflect the activity contexts relevant to our system's intended
                use. Based on this reassessment, we redefined the user population into three primary segments: Bikers,
                Pedestrians, and Individuals with Disabilities. These groups represent the main target audiences who
                could benefit from hands-free, haptic-based navigation assistance.</p>

            <p>For the present usability testing phase, the required participants are defined as follows:</p>
            <p>
                <li><b>18 years of age or older</b></li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li><b>Experienced cyclist or motorcyclist</b></li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li><b>Comfortable navigating while cycling or walking</b></li>
            </p>

            <p>This participant profile corresponds directly to the Biker and Pedestrian segments, which are the main
                focus of the current test sessions. While the Individuals with Disabilities segment is not explicitly
                targeted for recruitment at this stage, participation from this group remains welcome and encouraged
                should volunteers be available. We recognize that some additional interface and hardware adaptations
                would be necessary to fully accommodate specific accessibility needs, and these enhancements are planned
                for future iterations once the core interactions have been validated.</p>

        <!-- Usability Goals Section -->

            <h2 class="section-title">Usability Goals</h2>
            <p>The usability evaluation for the Glove Guide computer prototype focuses primarily on the software
                application, with an emphasis on how effectively it supports distraction-free navigation and intuitive
                interaction. The following usability goals were selected because they directly support the project's
                main objective: enabling users to receive navigation guidance through haptic cues while maintaining
                attention on their surroundings.</p>

            <p>While the physical components remain present during testing, this evaluation focuses on the user
                interaction with the mobile application. The collected data will provide quantitative insights into how
                efficiently and effectively users can interact with the system and how well the application supports
                calm, attentive navigation.</p>

        <!-- Usability Test Procedure Section -->
        <div class="content-section" id="test-procedure">
            <h2 class="section-title">Usability Test Procedure</h2>

            <p>The usability test will be conducted by a team of two to three examiners.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Equipment</h3>
            <p>In addition to the prototype described previously, the examiners will require a timer or stopwatch, pen
                and paper for note-taking, and an iOS smartphone for running the application (to be provided if the
                participant does not have one).</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Prototype Setup</h3>
            <p>Before the test begins, the participant will be asked to wear the physical components—either the
                lightweight fingerless gloves or the adjustable bracelets. The two vibration components are then
                securely taped to the corresponding physical parts, maintaining the same relative positions as before
                (<strong>left actuator</strong> to the left glove/bracelet, and <strong>right actuator</strong> to the
                right one). The software application is installed on the participant’s own phone or, if needed, on a
                preconfigured device provided by the examiners.</p>

            <p>A <strong>moderator</strong> operates the switches of the haptic actuators. Using a reference of the
                user-selected route, the moderator guides the participant throughout the test by activating and
                deactivating the actuators to simulate haptic navigation cues.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Examiner Roles and Conduct</h3>
            <p>While the moderator manages the haptic signals, the other one or two examiners are responsible for
                collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. They will record:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time taken</strong> for the participant to react to a haptic signal</li>
                <li><strong>Whether the participant checks their phone</strong> (Calm Technology metric)</li>
                <li><strong>Number of missed or misunderstood signals</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Time spent completing application-related tasks</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Examiners will also note any observable user behaviors, confusion, or spontaneous feedback relevant to
                usability.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Instructions to Participants</h3>
            <p>Participants are only to be given the task statements and any essential clarifications required to
                perform them. Examiners must not provide verbal guidance on how to use the prototype, nor offer
                explanations about system functions during the test.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Examiner Limitations</h3>
            <p>Examiners must avoid influencing the participants’ actions or expectations in any way. They should not
                suggest corrections, reveal expected outcomes, or discuss design intentions. Measurements are to be
                recorded in real time, beginning at the start of each task and ending upon task completion.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Ethical and Safety Considerations</h3>
            <p>Examiners should ensure that all participants are comfortable and informed of their right to withdraw at
                any time. For tests conducted in biking or walking scenarios, appropriate safety precautions must be
                taken—such as performing trials in a controlled or low-traffic environment. Participants should also be
                given short breaks between tasks if needed, as long-distance walking, biking, or running can be
                physically tiring, and extended focus on haptic feedback may also lead to temporary loss of attention.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Summary</h3>
            <p>This procedure ensures that an independent evaluation team can reproduce the usability test consistently,
                collect reliable quantitative data, and provide meaningful feedback on the prototype’s performance and
                user experience.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Measurement Guidelines</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Spent on Application (s):</strong> Begin timing once the task has been explained and
                    confirmed as understood. Stop the timer when the participant successfully completes the task or
                    abandons it.</li>
                <li><strong>Missed / Misinterpreted Signal (count):</strong> Record each instance where the participant
                    fails to respond to a haptic signal or responds incorrectly (e.g., turns right when a left-turn
                    vibration is indicated).</li>
                <li><strong>Reaction to Signal (s):</strong> When the moderator activates the haptic actuator, start the
                    timer simultaneously and stop it once the participant initiates the turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Phone Check (count):</strong> Note each instance in which the participant checks their phone
                    during the navigation task.</li>
                <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Record any noteworthy observations, such as confusion, hesitation, verbal
                    remarks, or environmental factors affecting performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Reporting Format</h3>
            <p>All collected data should be compiled into a consolidated results table identical in structure to the one
                above. This format enables direct comparison across participants and tasks, supporting both quantitative
                analysis and qualitative interpretation. Examiners are also encouraged to provide brief summary notes
                for each participant highlighting observed behavioral patterns or usability challenges.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Design Team Expectations and Potential Implications</h3>
            <p>The design team expects the following baseline outcomes for satisfactory usability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Spent on Application:</strong> ≤30 seconds on first use; ≤15 seconds once familiar with
                    the interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Missed / Misinterpreted Signal:</strong> ≤1 instance per navigation session.</li>
                <li><strong>Reaction Time:</strong> ≤2 seconds after receiving a turning signal.</li>
                <li><strong>Phone Check:</strong> ≤1 per navigation session.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Deviations from these thresholds suggest potential usability issues, most likely related to the vibration
                intensity or physical attachment quality (e.g., straps too loose, low actuator power, or user-adjusted
                vibration too weak). These findings will directly guide further refinement of the prototype’s hardware
                and feedback calibration.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Summary</h3>
            <p>This reporting structure ensures that all examiners collect and present data in a uniform and analyzable
                format, allowing the design team to identify specific weaknesses in both the haptic design and user
                interaction workflow.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Usability Evaluation</h2>

            <p><b>Evaluation Methodology:</b>
                The usability evaluation will consist of a <b>heuristic evaluation</b> conducted by an independent group
                of evaluators. Each evaluator will individually inspect the prototype—both the physical wearable and the
                iOS application—against a defined set of usability heuristics. Evaluators will document any violations
                or usability concerns and assign a <b>severity rating</b> (from 0 = no problem to 4 = usability
                catastrophe) following Nielsen's standard severity scale.</p>

            <p>After individual evaluations, the examiners will meet to <b>consolidate findings</b> and produce a
                combined summary report highlighting recurring issues, design strengths, and suggested improvements.</p>

            <h2>
                <p><b>Evaluation Tasks:</b></p>
            </h2>
            To ensure consistent coverage across the prototype's main interaction paths, evaluators will complete the
            following tasks before or during inspection:</p>

            <p><b>1. Adjust physical wearable:</b> Fit the fingerless glove or adjustable bracelet to assess ease of
                setup and comfort.</p>
            <p><b>2. Search and select destination:</b> Use the app's interface to search for a destination and confirm
                route selection.</p>
            <p><b>3. Navigate a known route:</b> Follow haptic feedback cues along a familiar path.</p>
            <p><b>4. Customize vibration settings:</b> Modify the vibration intensity and timing within the app's
                customization menu.</p>
            <p><b>5. Navigate an unknown route:</b> Use only haptic guidance to reach an unfamiliar destination.</p>
            <p><b>6. Dual task:</b> Perform an additional attention task (e.g., holding a short conversation while
                navigating) while navigating, to assess cognitive load and distraction resistance.</p>

            <h2>
                <p><b>Heuristics and Assessment Criteria:</b></p>
            </h2>

            <p>The evaluation will focus on the following heuristics, chosen for their relevance to a wearable haptic
                navigation system:</p>

            <p><b>Calm Technology:</b> The system should remain unobtrusive, allowing users to focus on the environment
                rather than the device. Evaluation will note how often users feel compelled to check the phone or are
                distracted by feedback.</p>

            <p><b>Match Between the System and the Real World:</b> The vibration patterns and app icons should follow
                intuitive real-world analogies (e.g., left-hand vibration → left turn). Evaluators will assess how
                naturally users interpret these cues.</p>

            <p><b>User Control and Freedom:</b> Users must be able to easily stop, restart, or adjust feedback intensity
                and duration. The evaluation will verify the visibility and accessibility of these controls.</p>

            <p><b>Recognition Rather Than Recall:</b> Interface elements and feedback patterns should be intuitive
                enough that users do not need to memorize how to operate the system or interpret vibrations. Evaluators
                will assess whether users can recognize functions and meanings immediately through design cues rather
                than relying on prior memorization.</p>

            <h2>
                <p><b>Evaluation Output:</b>
            </h2>
            Each evaluator will submit an annotated checklist containing their heuristic ratings, observed issues, and
            recommendations. The consolidated report will summarize:</p>

            <p>
                <li>Total number of violations per heuristic category</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Mean severity ratings</li>

            </p>

            <p><b>Summary:</b>
                This evaluation plan provides independent examiners with clear procedures, task descriptions, and
                criteria for judging usability. By combining heuristic inspection with focused task testing, it ensures
                a comprehensive assessment of both the app's interface and its physical interaction design.</p>

                system. The computer prototype successfully integrates both hardware and software components to provide
                a realistic sense of the final product's look and feel, allowing users to experience haptic guidance
                with minimal reliance on Wizard-of-Oz techniques.</p>

            <p>Through a combination of refined design decisions, detailed usability goals, and a comprehensive
                evaluation framework, the project now establishes a solid foundation for independent usability testing.
                The outlined test and reporting procedures ensure that quantitative and qualitative data can be
                collected consistently, while the heuristic evaluation plan provides structured insights into the
                system's intuitiveness and effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Together with the accompanying user manual, this deliverable equips the evaluation team with the
                information and tools necessary to assess the prototype independently, identify usability challenges,
                and guide the next iteration toward a more refined, user-centered design.</p>
